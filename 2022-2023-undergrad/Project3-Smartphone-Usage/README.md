# Title: An analysis of smartphone usage during Computer Science lectures

# Description
This is a **research** project and the student is expected to contribute to the writing of a peer-reviewed journal paper publication which will be extracted from the final dissertation report submitted.

This project will require extensive reading of literature and your thesis/disseration will need to have at least 30 - 40 references to journal papers in the area. This project is very suitable to students who are interested in a research/investigative project.

## Core project Idea
This project will develop a survey of students around smartphone usage during Computer Science lectures. The survey will be developed as a simple web-based or mobile application. Students will give feedback anonymously. Students will also be given the opportunity for one-to-one interviews. Lecturers and teachers know that smartphone usage is rampant in lectures and labs. There's not much that can be done about this as policies are hard to develop and even harder to implement. So why do students (not all students - some students) revert to smartphone usage during lectures and labs? What are the drivers and motivations? What supports could be provided to these students to alleviate the need to be using their phones during lecture and teaching sessions. We, of course, exclude situations where explicit use of digital devices is required in the lecture or classroom.

The survey of students should focus on Computer Science (final year or a selection of years or programmes). Of course, this does not have to restricted to Computer Science lectures. However, this can be discussed to ensure that the scope of the project does not extend beyond what is reasonable in the time allocated.

# Languages and areas of interest

As this is a research project the implementation language(s) is not a major issue. The student will need to have an interest in analysis of the results obtained in the survey. There is flexibility here - some additions include - building your own survey form(s), using NLP or ML to process the answers given by students, analysis of recordings and transcribing of interviews. Certainly an interest in statistical analysis, possibly some visualisation, and the investigative research process are essential.
