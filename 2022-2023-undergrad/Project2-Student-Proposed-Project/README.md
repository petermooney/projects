# Title: Student proposed project

# Description

Do you have an idea that you'd like to implement as your dissertation project? Maybe you have a cool idea but aren't sure if it is sufficient or appropriate as a Computer Science project.

# Languages and areas of interest

Ideally, Python (so I can be of some use to you). But if you propose the project you are free to choose the implementation language(s), framework(s) and so on. Indeed, perhaps you could use the project as a way to learn a new language or framework or technique.
