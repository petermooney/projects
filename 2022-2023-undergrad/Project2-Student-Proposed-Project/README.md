# Title: Student proposed project 2022-2023

# Description

Do you have an idea that you'd like to implement as your dissertation project? Maybe you have a cool idea but aren't sure if it is sufficient or appropriate as a Computer Science project.

DISCLAIMER - The proposed idea needs to pass two tests - firstly that it is of interest to me (in terms of supervision) and secondly that it has sufficient scope to qualify as a legitimate undergraduate project.

# Languages and areas of interest

Ideally, Python (so I can be of some use to you). But if you propose the project you are free to choose the implementation language(s), framework(s) and so on. Indeed, perhaps you could use the project as a way to learn a new language or framework or technique.

The area of interest can be anything (not necessarily from the list below)

* Data mining
* Artificial Intelligence
* Machine Learning
* Web application development 
* Mobile application development 
* A research project (with a scientific component to it)
* Visualisation 
* Social media or social networking
