# Welcome to my CS Projects repository

This is a repository of ideas, projects, and so on - useful for potential students. Over time this will become a historical archive of projects. However, if a project interests you from the collection let me know. There is always some flexibility around projects and new angles or ideas can always be distilled or added to existing descriptions.
