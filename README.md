# Welcome to my CS Projects repository

This is a repository of ideas, projects, and so on - useful for potential students. Over time this will become a historical archive of projects. However, if a project interests you from the collection let me know. There is always some flexibility around projects and new angles or ideas can always be distilled or added to existing descriptions.

The repository is an eclectic mix of different types of projects from many different research areas, applications and so on. *I'm only interested in supervising projects that interest me*.
